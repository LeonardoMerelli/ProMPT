I would just like to add that there should be a sort of follow-up after connecting the victims with relevant support services to be sure they are getting the best help they need to avoid putting them in a worse situation than we met them.    | Computer Vision: Analyzes drone and satellite imagery to assess infrastructure damage and prioritize reconstruction.                                                                                                                  |                                                                                    4 |                                                                       5 |                                            1 | Not something new, as I have mentioned earlier, there would be a need to work hand in hand with the locals to achieve the best of this suggestion. I am saying this as I believe if the locals/victims are not aware that the drones and machines are deployed to help them, it might cause more unrest within the locals who are just getting out a trauma.  | Data Analytics & Forecasting: Helps predict population displacement patterns and resource needs, supporting better humanitarian aid distribution and crisis planning. |                                                                       4 |                                                                                    5 |                                            2 | I would like to add that carrying out the forecasting should be swift and locals should be carried along incase they need to prepare for anything in future.                                   | Speech Recognition & Voice Synthesis: Facilitates real-time translation and communication in multilingual refugee camps, aiding both displaced people and aid workers. |                                                                                    5 |                                                                       4 |                                            2 | As much as I believe end-to-end encryption will help secure sensitive information, I would like to add that there is still a need to classify some information and categorize those who will have access to it, even among the locals, to avoid eavesdropping.            | AI-Recommendation Systems: Connects displaced individuals to relevant support services such as shelter or legal aid.                      |                                                                                    5 |                                                                       4 |                                            2 | I will suggest that a follow-up system should be put in place to monitor the help the victims are receiving.                                                                                                       | Computer Vision: Analyzes drone and satellite imagery to assess infrastructure damage and prioritize reconstruction.                                                                                                                  |                                                                                    4 |                                                                       3 |                                            2 | There might just be a need to double-check profiling and to avoid any sort of impersonation, which can lead to wrong profiling.                   |                                                             5 |                                                         5 |                                                                        4 |                                  4 |                                            5 |                                                                              5 |
